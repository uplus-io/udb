# UDb
Distributed Data Center.
Based on GOSSIP protocol, Cassandra implementation is used for reference.


I've been working on this for months and started thinking about it in last year. This time I want to make things interesting. I've read a lot of project source code for it, such as Cassandra, ETCD, Badger, GoLevel Db, BoltDb, Riot and so on. Thank them. I also read a lot of algorithmic books and source codes, thanks to gods, mmap-go.


The first version (**sansan**) is expected to be released on **9 August 2019**.
